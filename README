# keyhunter_Dean-Pierce
The code is taken from the Dean Pierce repository https://github.com/pierce403/keyhunter, thank him for this! And adapted to fit your needs. 
The code is kept for myself, but is available to those who are looking for a solution to run it. Added:  
Enter search directory 
Processing file indication 
Output the result to a text file


Anyone in the new branch can add functions for searching for keys, seed phrases, in files atypical for this, if they were placed there intentionally and forgotten.
Also, to add, it is desirable to search for files like valet with a changed name and extension. To connect to the new branch write to me here or email rwksent@gmail.com
